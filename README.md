# Mission to Mars

### Quick Summary

The following project set out to scrape data from a website that contained images of Mars. From this scraping four images were gathered and parsed into an html format to be displayed on a webpage. This was done through coding in Jupyter Notebook, Python, and html.

This project has many challenges as local host webpage displayments were not always accurate. However, code did seem to imply that the data entered was correct. As itterations and code become more and more difficult, issues with running the code will become more and more abundant. Code was reviewed several times to the best of my abilities to ensure the best product that I can currently display.

The biggest issues came about from computer crashes and issues with MongoDB and Flask. While most of these issues were resolved, work-arounds were very inefficient. Future work needs to be done on working with MongoDB and Flask properly.

I do not have much skill in designing a website with html and formatting, so some colors may not contrast the best. However, it was interesting to be taken back to the days of Myspace when one could edit their page with html. This time we are doing it with planets! I do not claim to be a web designer by any means, but I hope I can at least provide a page of sorts to display the data necessary!
